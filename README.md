# docs.graywhale.ai

This repo is for Gray Whale's public facing API and tools documentation using GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages utilizes the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) system and formatting.

Pages can be created in .md or .html format.

Pages can be organized into folders. So if a folder is setup called *api*, then the site address for that folder would be https://docs.graywhale.ai/api/
